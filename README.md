# Headless Calendar(v2.0.0)

It's just a tiny tool to help you make your dream Calendar UI.

## Install

```bash
npm i headless-calendar
```

## ‚ú® Features

- Use `for‚Ä¶of` loops or the spread syntax to breeze through your days.
- It finds the position of each day in a calendar for you.
- Set the week's starting day according to your preference.
- Handy utility functions for generating calendars of your chosen _month_, _year_, or _the last year_.
- Get day names, day numbers and month names in your chosen locale easily.

## Basic usage

```js
import { Calendar } from 'headless-calendar';

// üçÅ Basic Usage
const february = Calendar.ofMonth(2024, 2);

// Now you can easily get useful info for each day like below:
for (const day of february) {
  console.log(`-------- ${day.day} ${day.monthName()} ${day.year} --------`);
  console.log('Number of day: ', day.count);
  console.log('Day number of current month: ', day.day);
  console.log('Day number of current month in format: ', day.dayInFormat());
  console.log('Current Month number: ', day.month);
  console.log('Current year: ', day.year);
  console.log('Where the day is in a week: ', day.weekdayIndex);
  console.log('Where the day is in terms of passed weeks: ', day.weekIndex);
  console.log('Day name', day.dayName());
  console.log('Current month name', day.monthName());
  console.log(
    'Is it the first start weekday of current month?',
    day.isFirstStartWeekdayOfMonth
  );
}
```

You can also get the days of a particular time period, year or even
last year like below and get same set of informations as shown above:

```js
const someDays = Calendar.custom([2024, 1, 15], [2024, 2, 1]);
const year2042 = Calendar.ofYear(2042);
const lastYear = Calendar.ofLastYear(); // from 364 days ago to today
```

`Calendar.custom(...)` is the same as `new Calendar()`. All `Calendar.<method>`s (namely `custom`, `ofMonth`, `ofYear` and `ofLastYear`) return an instance of `Calendar`.
